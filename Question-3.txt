Question :
=========

1. If an application was exhibiting slow database access speeds (MySQL 5.6), detail a checklist to determine the cause of issues

Solution :
=========
So before we go and tune the MySQL application; we first have a look at the System/server level bottle necks :
  1) Since this is happening in accessing the data from the disk; we need to check the Disk I/O 
      which can be viewed by few Inbuilt Linux commands such as : iostat 
  for example :
========
iostat 
Linux 3.19.5-200.fc21.x86_64 (heavenbig-dl.eglbp.corp.yahoo.com) 	11/21/2016 	_x86_64_	(4 CPU)

dm-0              1.00         1.48        11.76    1187749    9406132
dm-1              0.80         0.17        15.98     138648   12785864
dm-2              0.04         0.02         0.16      13573     126836
========
If we check the write and read speed of the disk where mysql is storing data and if the reads/sec is very huge then we should consider changing the data to a DISK with Higher performance ( something like SSD ) 



Apart from that we can check processor. memory, network, swap related issues to see if this is a system related issue.

Now Optimizing or tuning application :
=============================

As per my knowledge and work experience on database from my previous company the 3 basic MySQL performance tuning settings that we should always look at is :

1) innodb_buffer_pool_size   : The buffer pool is where data and indexes are cached: having it as large as possible will ensure you use memory and not disks for most read operations.
2) innodb_log_file_size         :  This is the size of the redo logs and The redo logs are used to make sure writes are fast and durable
3) Max_connections              : We might need to consider increasing from the default value.

Apart from these we can also try to tune the following settings :

innodb_file_per_table

innodb_flush_method

innodb_log_buffer_size

query_cache_size

log_bin
